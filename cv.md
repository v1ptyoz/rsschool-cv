## About me
Hello everyone! As your understood - my name is Aleksandr, and I'm a junior JS-developer.
Programming has a most important place in my life. I like to automate everything in my work.
Also, I like to write a programming code. So, I'm learning some programming languages for five years.
But, only with a Javascript I decided to change my life and become a programmer.
Next, I'll tell you about my skills and projects.
